# Practical-Task

This is very basic CRUD application for Employees.
here I've used Anguler 18 For front end development and .Net 8 for API development.
Used EF core as ORM and MSSQLSever as DBMS.
Further it can be improve more applying more OOP concepts, SOLID principles, solution architecturels, design patterns, Validations and so-on.
